## Description
Place to live is one of the basic needs possessed by humans as living beings. The development of human dwellings or homes always goes hand in hand with human development until now there are various types of dwellings such as conventional houses, apartments, and temporary residences such as hotels, rental houses, or boarding houses which are often associated with the student life phase. 
	
With the various choices of boarding houses available, there are certainly many factors that can determine the success of a boarding house manager in doing his job, such as credibility, connectedness, satisfaction, and others. It is appropriate for boarding house owners and managers to start using technological assistance to improve these success factors. One of the simplest to implement is a web-based boarding house management system to improve the values of these success factors. With this system, it is expected to improve the quality of interaction from the owner, user, and manager of the boarding house to improve the comfort of all parties.
